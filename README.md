# VBA-challenge

# Create a new repository for this project called VBA-challenge

# Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

## The ticker symbol
## Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
## The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
## The total stock volume of the stock.

# Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

# Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

# Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
