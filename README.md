# VBA-challenge

In this assignment, I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
'The ticker symbol.
'Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
'The total stock volume of the stock.

I also added to my script a function that returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

The first excel worksheet screenshots shows the output table for 2018
  'In this year, the ticker with the Greatest % increase was THB with a value of 141.42%.
  'The ticker with the Greatest % decrease was RKS with a value of -90.02%
  'The ticker with the Greatest total volume was QKN with a value of 1.69E+12
